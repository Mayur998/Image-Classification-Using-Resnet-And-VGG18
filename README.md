# Image-Classification-Using-Resnet-And-VGG18
STL-10 is an image recognition dataset inspired by CIFAR-10 dataset with some improvements. With a corpus of 100,000 unlabeled images and 500 training images, this dataset is best for developing unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, self-taught learning algorithms. Unlike CIFAR-10, the dataset has a higher resolution which makes it a challenging benchmark for developing more scalable unsupervised learning methods.

We have used Resnet18 And VGG18 pretrained model for Image Classification.
